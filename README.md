The MDS program implements an application that is able to store 
items and their corresponding id, price, and descriptions. The applications
organizes the properties of items in the appropriate data structures to 
optimize search operations for each search field. 

The application allows the user to insert new items and update the information 
of existing items, find the prices of a specific item, delete items, 
find the minimum and maximum prices of a collection of items, find the number
of items that fall under a certain range of prices, and modifies the descriptions
of certain items.
